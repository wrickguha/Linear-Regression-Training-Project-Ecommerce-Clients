# Linear-Regression-Training-Project-Ecommerce-Clients

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression to analyze and predict customer behavior in an e-commerce setting. The goal is to develop a model that predicts the amount of money spent by customers based on various factors such as time spent on the website, time spent on the mobile app, and membership status.

Key Features:
Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between different variables and the target variable (customer spending).
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Implemented a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict customer spending.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Performed cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Visualization: Created visualizations to better understand the relationships between variables and the model's predictions.


Technologies Used:

Python

scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib/Seaborn

This project is a practical example of how linear regression can be applied in a real-world scenario to help businesses understand and predict customer behavior, enabling more informed decision-making.

Objective:

The objective of the Linear Regression Training Project: Ecommerce Clients is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer spending based on various factors such as time spent on the website, time spent on the mobile app, and membership status. By applying linear regression techniques, this project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, enabling e-commerce businesses to make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
